# Predicting Credit Card Consumption

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the average credit card spend of customers for the next three months using their demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The project is based on three datasets provided by a leading bank:
1. **CustomerDemographics.xlsx** – Contains customer demographic info (e.g., age, gender, income).
2. **CustomerBehaviorData.xlsx** – Details on past credit/debit card usage, loans, and transactions.
3. **CreditConsumptionData.xlsx** – Target variable (`cc_cons`) - average credit card consumption for the upcoming 3 months.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Merging & Cleaning
- All datasets merged using `ID`.
- Missing values imputed:
  - Numeric: Median
  - Categorical: Mode
- Target variable (`cc_cons`) has 5,000 missing values – prediction required for these.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots, boxplots, and scatterplots used to analyze patterns in credit consumption.
- Found skewed distribution with spending differences across income groups and no strong age correlation.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Categorical features: One-Hot Encoded.
- Numeric features: Standard preprocessing applied.
- Columns like `loan_enq` and investment flags treated as categorical.

### 4. Model Building
- **Model Used**: RandomForestRegressor
- **Validation Split**: 80-20 Train-Test
- **Metric**: RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error)

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Achieved RMSPE of ~28.83% on validation data.
- Model found to be reliable for predictions in this context.
